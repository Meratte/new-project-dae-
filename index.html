            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li class="my-2">We are a non-profit organization that tries to help students choose the <em>right</em> track for them.</li>

        <div class="my-4">
            You got here because you have these many <strong>passions</strong>, but you don't know which one is going to be sustainable over time, what the job market is like for this, and most importantly - how do you <em>choose one?</em>
        </div>
        <div class="my-4">
            Our product offers it all - type one job and get an output on research articles, salaries, and requirements for the job! And, if you're hungry for even more, you can also explore other careers that will be mapped with one of your passions.

        <div class="my-4">
            Let's say that you're interested in the arts - you can choose it as a passion and get a list of careers as well as resources on how <strong>you</strong> can get there. If for whatever reason you decide not to explore it further (our quizzes won't do good or you get bored) you can always change it and focus on one passion at a time!
